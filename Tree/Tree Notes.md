# Tree Traversals
## Preorder TRAVERSAL
Root, Left, Right

## Inorder Traversal
Left, Root, Right

## Postorder Traversal
Left, Right, Root

# Types of Trees
## 1. Binary Tree
In binary every node has at max 2 child nodes

## 2. Binary Search Tree
In binary search tree elements are stored in the sorted order, i.e elements towards the left are less than or equal to root node and elements toward the right are greater than root node.

## 3. Full Binary Tree
In full binary tree, each node consists of 2 or 0 nodes.

## 4. Complete Binary Tree
In this tree all the level are filled completely. Except the last level and in last level elements are filled from left to right.

## 5. Perfect Binary Tree
In this tree every node consists of 2 nodes, all the nodes are completely filled and leaf nodes are on the same level.
